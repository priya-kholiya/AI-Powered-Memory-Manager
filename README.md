# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
=======
* AI-Powered-Memory-Manager
An Operating Systems project to reduce page faults using Predictive AI-based Page Replacement.

* Project Overview
This project is an Operating Systems(OS) simulation that demonstrates how AI-powered page replacement can reduce page faults in memory management.

Traditional algorithms like FIFO and LRU have limitations. Our approach integrates an AI Predictor to make smarter page replacement decisions.

* Objectives
- Implement a Memory Simulator for page requests.
- Compare FIFO, LRU, and AI-based predictive replacement.
- Measure page fault rate, execution time, and memory utilization.
- Show how AI can reduce page faults in real systems.
