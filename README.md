* AI-Powered-Memory-Manager
An Operating Systems project to reduce page faults using Predictive AI-based Page Replacement.

* Project Overview
This project is an Operating Systems(OS) simulation that demonstrates how AI-powered page replacement can reduce page faults in memory management.

Traditional algorithms like FIFO and LRU have limitations. Our approach integrates an AI Predictor to make smarter page replacement decisions.

* Objectives
- Implement a Memory Simulator for page requests.
- Compare FIFO, LRU, and AI-based predictive replacement.
- Measure page fault rate, execution time, and memory utilization.
- Show how AI can reduce page faults in real systems.
